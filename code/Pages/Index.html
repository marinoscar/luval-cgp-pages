                <h1>Welcome to the CGP Automation SharePoint Community</h1>
                <p>The purpose of this site is to provide CGP practitioners access to our latest sales and pursuit materials, Automation delivery methods and templates, as well as practice information and knowledge materials. It also allows us to share our very best intellectual property with our GDS and SDC team members as well as our extended Regional and Sector teams in an effort to function as one, integrated, high performing team.</p>
                <p>Intelligent Automation (IA), including Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a dynamic, rapidly growing competency that includes a spectrum of supporting technologies to provide exciting next generation, transformational opportunities for our clients.  IA is also a significant, high growth practice for our Firm. A consistent sales and delivery approach using a proven, standardized methodology is a key component in ensuring we increase our win rate through clear differentiation as well as the quality, efficiency and profitability of our delivery engagements. Our consistent methodology also helps us to grow by allowing us to train and orient new members faster.</p>
                <p>We do not expect that this site will be static. It is our intent that the site will continue to expand and evolve as the team submits suggestions and new, leading practice materials to the Governing Committee. I would like to thank Dan Trent and Albert Hahm (Sales and Marketing), Tony Castagno, Oscar Marin and Mord Pal (Delivery Methodology), Scott Geddes (Practice Management) and Cory Hindel (Project Manager) for their efforts in constructing the site and organizing the content. This team, along with myself, will serve as our original Governing Committee responsible for collecting, reviewing and updating each portion of the site. </p>
                <p>We already have a market leading IA practice (ranked #1 globally by Horses for Sources in 2018) that is a real asset to EY and something that should be a source of pride for all team members. My hope is that we will capitalize on our momentum and commit to an aggressive and diligent "culture of excellence" that will keep us #1 for years to come.</p>
                <p>
                    All the best,
                    Jeff Aldridge, Americas Intelligent Automation Leade
